This is the first 4 days of my time spend at 42 silicon valley in their first and only ruby piscine.
This was in my early days of coding when I had minor ability in python and no prior experience with ruby.
Unfortunatly the rest of the code I wrote from the following week and a half has been lost and permanently deleted from 42's servers.
The best program from what remains is a humble tic-tac-toe program using acii animation. enjoy!
